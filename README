Lightspark is an open source Flash player implementation for playing
files in SWF format. Lightspark can run as a web browser plugin or as
a standalone application.

Lightspark supports SWF files written on the newest version of the
ActionScript language, ActionScript 3.0, which was introduced at the
same time as Flash player 9.

llvm (version 2.8 or >= 3.0), opengl, curl, zlib, libavcodec, libavresample
libglew, pcre, librtmp, cairo, libboost-filesystem, 
gtk-2, libjpeg, libavformat, pango, liblzma

If sound is enabled (on by default), you will also need the
development package for pulseaudio-libs and/or sdl_mixer.

1) cd lightspark
2) mkdir obj
3) cd obj
4) cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
5) make
6) sudo make install

-DAUDIO_BACKEND=<pulseaudio|sdl> (default is pulseaudio)

EXECUTION
=========

Using `make install`, lightspark is installed in the system wide

Browser plugin
--------------

Firefox plugin path and Firefox should show it in the about:plugins
list and in the Tools->Add-ons->Plugins window.

Lightspark registers itself as the plugin for
application/x-shockwave-flash and for application/x-lightspark, so it
should be recognisable in the about:plugins page. Its description
string is "Shockwave Flash 12.1 r<current version>". The current
version is now "r710".

Firefox is not able to deal very well with multiple plugins for the
same MIME type. If you only see a black box where a flash app should
be try to remove any other flash plugin you have installed.

Command line
------------

The command line version of Lightspark can play a local SWF file.
Execution: lightspark file.swf

Type `lightspark` to see all command line options.

Keyboard shortcuts
------------------

Ctrl+Q Quit (standalone player only)
Ctrl+M Mute/unmute sounds
Ctrl+P Show profiling data
Ctrl+C Copy an error to the clipboard (when Lightspark fails)
