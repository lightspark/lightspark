0.5.1 - August 2011

User visible changes:
- Flowplayer support
- initial GLES2/EGL rendering backend, used to get hardware acceleration on ARM based devices
- Support for loading external JPEGs
- Drop half-finished support for AVM1 files, those should be handled by Gnash only.
- Better text handling (e.g. coloring)

Developer visible changes:
- Logging:
	LOG_ERROR is the highest priority log level instead of LOG_NO_INFO which was renamed
	to LOG_INFO to better reflect its purpose.
	The LIGHTSPARK_PLUGIN_LOGLEVEL environment variable controls the log level of the browser
	plugin.
- Testsuite:
	./tests -p|--proprietary runs the testsuit with the proprietary player. This can be used
	to test the testsuit for reasonable tests. The testsuit should pass on the proprietary player.
- Templates:
	See the classes Template, Template_base, TemplatedClass for the handling of AS templates and
	Vector for an implementation of an AS template.
- Class_base::getClass() semantics changed: getClass() returns the Class_base* object without
	incRef'ing it. If you need a reference you can keep, use getRef().
	Especially getRef is used in sinit() for setting 'super'
	and for builtin->setVariableByQName().
