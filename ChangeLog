lightspark: An open source flash player implementation

Version NEXT:

	* implement DefineScalingGrid tag
	* switch to 32bit float audio sampling for standalone player and remove SDL2_mixer dependency

Version 0.8.6.1:

	* Hotfix to get sound working on Windows, no changes for Linux

Version 0.8.6:

	* implement support for GIF images (single image GIFs only)
	* add commandline parameter (--fullscreen) to start lightspark in fullscreen mode

	* embed nanovg for faster rendering of large vector graphics
	* less memory usage
	* partial support for loading AIR extensions by command line parameter
	* improved support for Stage3D
	* remove dependency on gettext (we don't have any strings that need translation anyway)
	* partially implement some Adobe AIR classes in flash.filesystem
	* implement DefineButtonSound tag
	* always enable local storage when running standalone executable
	* local storage files (*.sol) are saved in same format as adobe, so saved data from adobe can be used in lightspark (and vice versa)
	  this means that saved data from older versions of lightspark is not compatible with this version!
	* improved support for background workers
	* implement streaming of dynamically created audio samples
	* add environment variable LIGHTSPARK_RANDOM_SEED to seed random number generator with constant value (useful for debugging)

	* make NPAPI plugin windowless, now it works on Firefox > version 52
	* add ppapi plugin for use with chromium based browsers
	* switch to SDL2/SDL2_mixer for everything except Firefox plugin.
	  - the plugin uses gtk2 to interact with Firefox, so the gtk2 dependency is only needed when building the Firefox plugin
	  - removes audio plugins as audio is now handled via SDL2_mixer for all platforms.
	  - removes the pulseaudio dependency
	  - the configuration setting [audio] is no longer needed
	* implement rendering of embedded fonts in TextFields
