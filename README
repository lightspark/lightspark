CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE available: Debug Release RelWithDebInfo Profile

EXECUTION:
Using `make install`, lightspark is installed in the system wide Firefox plugin
path and Firefox should show it in the about:plugins list and in the
Tools->Add-ons->Plugins window.

Lightspark registers itself as the plugin for application/x-shockwave-flash and
for application/x-lightspark, so it should be recognisable in the about:plugins
page. Its description string is "Shockwave Flash 10.2 r<current version>". The
current version is now "r470".

Firefox is not able to deal very well with multiple plugins for the same MIME
type. If you only see a black box where a flash app should be try to remove any
other flash plugin you have installed.
